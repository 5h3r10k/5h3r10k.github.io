                Remote-Controlled Car with Arduino</h1>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

            </div>
            <p>My journey into the fascinating world of Arduino began not long ago. It was fueled by a mix of nostalgia and
                a
                newfound passion for programming. The spark that ignited my interest was an old remote-controlled car
                gathering dust
                in my closet. An engaging Udemy course opened my eyes to the possibilities of Arduino as a versatile tool
                for both
                hobbyists and professionals. This project was not just about revisiting a childhood joy, but also a
                practical
                application of my learning in programming and electronics. In this project, I transformed an old toy into a
                high-tech Arduino-powered remote-controlled car.</p>
            <h2 id="assembly-of-components">Assembly of Components</h2>
            <p>Before diving into the new, it was essential to honor the old. I started by removing the existing printed
                circuit
                board (PCB) from the old RC car, cleaning the chassis, and salvaging any old power cables and motor wires
                that could
                be reused. This initial step was crucial in setting a clean foundation for the new setup.</p>

            </div>
            <h3 id="arduino">Arduino</h3>
            <p>The heart of my project—the Arduino board—was the first component to be installed. It served as the central
                processing unit, controlling all the functionalities of the car.</p>
            <div class="essayImgContainer">

            </div>
            <h3 id="distance-sensor">Distance Sensor</h3>
            <p>Next, I added a distance sensor, a critical component for obstacle detection. This sensor would allow the car
                to
                perceive its surroundings and make autonomous decisions when encountering obstacles.</p>

                <img src="img/proj/distance-1.jpeg" alt="Distance sensor top">
                <img src="img/proj/distance-2.jpeg" alt="Distance sensor side">
            </div>
            <h3 id="radio-module">Radio Module</h3>
            <p>Communication is key, even for an RC car. The radio module enabled the transmission and reception of control
                signals
                from the remote (Wii nunchuk) to the car, ensuring responsive and smooth control over the vehicle.</p>
            <h3 id="motor-driver">Motor Driver</h3>
            <p>To drive the car's motors, a motor driver was necessary. This component allowed for precise control over
                the
                speed and direction of the car's motors, based on signals from the Arduino.</p>
            <div class="essayImgContainer">
                <img src="img/proj/motor-driver.jpeg" alt="Motor driver">
            </div>
            <h3 id="wii-nunchuk-and-wiichuk-adapter">Wii Nunchuk and Wiichuk Adapter</h3>
            <p>For a unique twist, I repurposed a Wii nunchuk as the remote control. Connected through a Wiichuk adapter, it
                offered
                a familiar yet innovative way to steer the car.</p>
            <h2 id="programming-and-debugging">Programming and Debugging</h2>
            <p>The first step in the programming subsequence was establishing reliable communication between the Wii nunchuk
                and the car via the radio module. This required meticulous programming to ensure that the nunchuk's inputs were
                accurately translated into movements by the car.</p>
            <p>Programming the car to respond to these inputs involved creating functions for forward/reverse movements and
                steering. Each function had to be carefully tested to ensure smooth and responsive control.</p>

            </div>
            <h3 id="advanced-features">Advanced Features</h3>
            <p>I also programmed the car with advanced features like active obstacle detection using the distance sensor,
                speed
                mapping, and automatic obstacle avoidance during inertial movement. This step was particularly challenging
                but
                rewarding, as it imbued the car with a level of autonomy.</p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As I sit back and reflect on the project that I recently completed, I feel an immense sense of pride in what
                I have
                accomplished. This project presented me with a variety of challenges that allowed me to grow both
                intellectually and
                practically. The process of assembling the car was not only a fun and tactile experience, but also an
                opportunity to
                learn more about how different components work together to create a functioning system.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, the real challenge came when I had to dive into the complex world of programming. While initially
                daunting,
                the experience taught me a lot about the intricacies of coding and problem-solving. Although there were
                occasional
                setbacks, like the fried radio module, these setbacks provided me with an opportunity to hone my
                problem-solving
                skills and learn from my mistakes.</p>
                <br>
            <p>One of the most significant challenges I encountered was the task of a full code rewrite. However, this
                challenge
                turned out to be one of the most rewarding parts of the project. It was an opportunity to start from
                scratch,
                evaluate my previous code, and make improvements that I would not have been able to make otherwise.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As I look towards the future, I am eager to embark on more projects that offer a chance to further explore
                the
                intersection of technology and creativity. The experience I gained from this project has left me feeling
                more
                confident in my abilities and excited to continue learning and growing as a tech enthusiast.</p>
