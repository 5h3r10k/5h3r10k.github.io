                When I first embarked on the journey of recording and sharing each week of my trash, it was driven by a deep-seated curiosity. I was intrigued to discover precisely what items I regularly discard. This personal audit started a superficial task but yielded an introspective journey into my daily habits and lifestyle choices. By documenting every piece of waste I generated, I aimed to understand my ecological footprint better.
                <br><br>
                The process was enlightening, especially in recognizing the sheer volume of recyclables in my trash. It highlighted the importance of mindful recycling and its impact on reducing landfill waste. Additionally, the exercise brought to my attention the prevalence of single-use items in my daily life. This realization prompted a shift to reusable alternatives, significantly cutting down my weekly waste.
                <br><br>
                An example of this change was in my commuting habits. I transitioned from using disposable MetroCards to a tap-to-pay system on my phone. This small but significant change made my daily commute more convenient and aligned with my goal to reduce waste.
                <br><br>
                Sharing this journey publicly added a layer of accountability and community interaction. It turned my project into a collective effort, encouraging others to reflect on their waste habits and make sustainable choices.
                <br><br>
                This project was a transformative experience that deepened my commitment to sustainability. It reinforced the idea that individual actions, like choosing a digital payment method over a physical card or opting for reusable items, can collectively drive significant environmental change.

            <p>
                This week marked a significant milestone in my waste reduction journey, highlighted by two major shifts: the complete transition from traditional MetroCards to a more sustainable tap-to-pay system on my phone and replacing my car phone cable for the first time. These changes represent a move towards more sustainable practices and a reduction in the frequency of such replacements. Interestingly, this week, I found that it took longer to accumulate a substantial amount of trash, signaling a decrease in my overall waste generation. A positive pattern that has emerged is the predominance of recyclables in my waste stream, indicating a successful shift towards materials that can be reclaimed and repurposed.

            <h3>Unneeded Print Items</h3>
            <p>
                The "Unneeded Print Items" group consists of objects that have served their purpose and are no longer required. Once a staple of my daily commute, the MetroCard is a thin, yellow/blue plastic card, now replaced by a digital tap-to-pay system on my phone. I acquired it several months ago for PATH access, but with the digital shift, it's become obsolete. An old coupon, now expired, is a crumpled piece of paper with bold promotional text, which I had kept in my wallet for a Halloween store discount (I guess the mask collection will have to start next Halloween). The old shipping label, a rectangular sticker with faded printing, is from a package I received last month. It's a reminder of an online gift purchase for my mom. While once useful, these items have lost their relevance and contribute to paper waste.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Depleted Items</h3>
            <p>
                The "Depleted Items" are everyday products I've used to their full capacity. The empty air freshener, a small, plastic casing that disperses vapors from a liquid pod, once filled my room with a fresh linen scent. I bought it last fall to freshen up my living space. The empty mouthwash bottle, a transparent plastic with a white cap, was a part of my daily oral hygiene routine for the past few months. With its faded black body, a depleted expo marker was a tool for brainstorming sessions on my whiteboard, often used during work-from-home meetings. Lastly, the empty mint container, a small, rectangular black/green paper pouch, was always in my bag for fresh breath on the go, purchased before a significant job interview. Each item, now empty or depleted, signifies the end of its utility life.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>Small Random Items</h3>
            <p>
                The "Small Random Items" category encompasses various miscellaneous objects. An old jingle bell, a small, rusty metal, reminds me of a past Christmas decoration. It has a faint jingle that once added festive cheer to my home. A packet of silica gel, a tiny, bead-filled sachet, came tucked inside a new pair of shoes to keep them dry. It's an often overlooked but essential item for moisture control. With its frayed edges and exposed wires, the worn-out charging cable has been a faithful companion, charging my phone in my car for 2 years now. These small, random items, each with their unique backstory, have outlived their usefulness and are now part of my weekly waste.

            <h2 id = "oftheweek">Item of the Week</h2>
            <p>
                I've selected the worn-out charging cable for this week's memoir, a seemingly mundane yet integral part of my daily life. This cable, a standard USB to USB-C connector, was included with a new phone from Google. Its primary function was to charge my phone and facilitate music streaming and navigation in my car. Over time, it became more than just a cable; it was a companion on countless road trips, a crucial aid during urgent phone calls, and a source of entertainment as it played my favorite playlists. However, the connection strength has significantly weakened due to weather changes, signaling the end of its serviceable life.

                Delving into the history and impact of such cables, they emerged as a technological staple in the early 21st century, revolutionizing how we connect and power our devices. Typically made from copper, rubber, and plastic, their production involves significant resource extraction and manufacturing processes. While they have become indispensable in our digital age, their environmental impact is non-negligible, contributing to e-waste when discarded improperly. The cable's lifespan and disposal raise questions about sustainability and the need for more durable, eco-friendly alternatives. As I bid farewell to this cable, it's a reminder of the delicate balance between technological convenience and environmental responsibility.
