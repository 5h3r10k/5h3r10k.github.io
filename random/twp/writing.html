            <h1>Writing</h1>

            <p>
                Embarking on the project of documenting and sharing my weekly trash collection was an endeavor born not just from curiosity but from a desire to engage deeply with the intricate tapestry of waste management, sustainability, and personal accountability. At its core, this journey was a quest to illuminate the shadows cast by the objects we discard, a process that Brian Thill describes as turning the "indifference engine" of litter into a subject of scrutiny and care <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Thill, 20)</a>. By adopting this lens, I sought not only to understand my own ecological footprint but also to initiate a dialogue with others on the pervasive issue of waste in our modern lives.

            <h2>Perspectives</h2>
            <p>
                The project, which began as a simple audit of my daily waste, evolved into a profound exploration of the ways in which our throwaway culture permeates our lifestyles. It was an attempt to confront the "revolution" that, as Muniz observes, "filled the world with objects that trivialized their own production and, consequently, their meaning" <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Muniz)</a>. This trivialization of objects, once essential and desired, morphs into indifference once their utility wanes. My aim was to challenge this indifference by highlighting the lifecycle of the items we consider disposable, thereby fostering a deeper connection with the material world around us.
                <br><br>
                In engaging with Newman's perspective that "Archaeology has sometimes been called 'the science of rubbish'" <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Newman)</a>, I sought to position my project not just as a personal journal or museum of discarded items but as a living archive that reflects both individual and collective memory, history, and culture. This approach allowed me to explore the intersection of waste and identity, examining how our trash can serve as a mirror to our societal values and individual choices.
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Themes</h2>
            <p>
                The transition towards sustainability was a key theme in my project, echoing the calls of Victor Vergara and Ramachandra Jammi for a shift from the linear economic model to a more sustainable approach like the circular economy <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Vergara and Jammi)</a>. This paradigm shift was mirrored in my own journey as I moved from using disposable items to adopting reusable alternatives, such as transitioning from disposable MetroCards to a tap-to-pay system. This change, though seemingly minor, was a step towards minimizing my personal contribution to landfill waste and exemplifying the potential for individual actions to foster collective environmental change.
                <br><br>
                The project also drew inspiration from other online trash-related endeavors, notably the Clean Bin Project and Blog, which posits that "Living zero waste isn’t about deprivation; it’s about living with less and figuring out better solutions that just happen not to involve disposable packaging" <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(The Clean Bin Project and Blog)</a>. This ethos resonated deeply with my own experiences, reinforcing the idea that sustainability is not about sacrifice but about finding innovative and mindful ways to engage with the world.

            </figure>

            <h2>Outro</h2>
            <p>
                In documenting my journey, the project became more than just a personal audit; it evolved into a collective exploration of waste, identity, and sustainability. It straddled the line between an activist awareness-raising project and an art project, using the cataloging of daily waste as a medium to express a broader narrative on consumption, waste, and environmental responsibility. It was both exploratory and planned, a reflective practice that encouraged not just personal introspection but also communal dialogue.
                <br><br>
                As this project unfolded, it became clear that the act of documenting trash is not merely about the objects themselves but about challenging the norms of consumption and disposal that define our current epoch. It is an invitation to reconsider our roles not just as consumers but as stewards of our environment, to move beyond indifference and towards a more thoughtful and sustainable interaction with the world.

            <p>
                Embarking on a journey to chronicle and share the evolution of my waste generation each week was initially fueled by curiosity and a desire to scrutinize my everyday contributions to ecological footprints. What began as a superficial audit of my discarded items quickly morphed into an introspective expedition, unraveling the nuances of my lifestyle choices and daily habits. This endeavor was not just about tallying up thrown-away objects; it was an effort to forge a deeper understanding of my environmental impact. The enlightening journey revealed a significant volume of recyclables amidst my refuse, underscoring the critical role of conscientious recycling in mitigating landfill accumulation. The discovery of my frequent use of single-use items led me to pivot towards reusable alternatives, thereby reducing my weekly waste footprint. My commuting routine, transitioning from disposable MetroCards to a more sustainable tap-to-pay system on my phone, was a prime illustration of this shift. While seemingly minor, this adaptation significantly aligned my daily practices with my overarching waste reduction goal. Publicizing this project introduced a dimension of accountability and community engagement, transforming my solitary venture into a collective dialogue to inspire sustainable lifestyle modifications, among others. This project was a transformative journey that heightened my commitment to sustainability and highlighted the power of individual choices in driving substantial environmental change.

            <h2>Perspectives</h2>
            <p>
                The relationship between archaeology and rubbish, highlighted by Newman's assertion that "Archaeology has sometimes been called 'the science of rubbish,'" is a poignant reminder of the historical and cultural significance embedded in what we discard <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Newman)</a>. This perspective enriches the foundation of my project by framing waste not just as an environmental concern but as a historical artifact that offers insights into our daily lives, consumption patterns, and societal values. Through the lens of archaeology, my project transcends its immediate ecological implications, inviting a broader contemplation of how our waste serves as a testament to our era's lifestyle, technologies, and challenges. This angle introduces a nuanced layer to the project, suggesting that our trash, much like the remnants explored by archaeologists, holds the potential to inform future generations about the complexities of our time.
                <br><br>
                Brian Thill's contemplation on litter as "the indifference engine that drives litter is the flip side of desire" illuminates waste generation's psychological and societal dynamics <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Thill, 20)</a>. This reflection probes deeper into the transient nature of our desires and how they culminate in the disregard for objects once valued. Thill's insight is instrumental in framing my project as a critique of consumer culture, highlighting the transient satisfaction derived from material possessions and their eventual relegation to trash. This observation encourages reevaluating our consumption habits, urging a shift towards sustainability and mindfulness; by documenting and sharing my waste, the project endeavors to confront and transform the indifference Thill describes, fostering a collective consciousness about the lifecycle of our possessions and the environmental implications of our throwaway culture.
                <br><br>
                Viktor Muniz's commentary on the trivialization of objects in our contemporary world, "This revolution filled the world with objects that trivialized their production and, consequently, their meaning," resonates profoundly with the ethos of my project <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Muniz)</a>. Muniz's critique of mass production and the diminishing significance of objects in our lives provides a critical backdrop for my endeavor. By focusing on the ephemeral nature of everyday items and their swift journey from being coveted to discarded, the project echoes Muniz's concerns about the loss of meaning and value in our consumption-driven society. This reflection underscores the need for a more conscious and deliberate approach to consumption, where the lifecycle of products is considered and disposability is challenged. In documenting the waste journey, my project serves as a narrative that questions and seeks to alter the current paradigm of trivialized consumption.
                <br><br>
                The perspectives of Victor Vergara and Ramachandra Jammi on the imperative shift towards a circular economy, alongside the Clean Bin Project's advocacy for a zero-waste lifestyle, converge on the theme of sustainable living <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Vergara and Jammi; Clean Bin Project)</a>. These voices collectively underscore the critical need to rethink our linear consumption patterns and embrace models that prioritize reuse, recycling, and sustainability. The alignment of these perspectives with my project reinforces the notion that individual actions, such as opting for digital payments or reusable goods, are integral to the broader movement toward environmental stewardship. These insights validate the practical changes I've implemented and contribute to a larger discourse on sustainable practices and the role of the community in effecting environmental change.

            <h2>Themes</h2>
            <p>
                However, the viewpoints present a nuanced spectrum of approaches to dealing with waste. While Newman and Thill provide a cultural and psychological examination of waste, highlighting its historical and emotional dimensions, Muniz and Vergara, Jammi, and the Clean Bin Project emphasize the practical and systemic aspects of waste management and reduction. This divergence underscores the complexity of addressing waste, suggesting that a multifaceted approach that encompasses both reflections on consumption patterns and tangible lifestyle adjustments is essential.

            <p>
                In synthesizing these ideas, my project is a microcosm of a more significant movement towards sustainability. It is a personal journey of awareness and an activist project aimed at inspiring collective action. Through cataloging and reflecting on my waste, the project serves as both a journal of my evolution and a museum showcasing the broader cultural and environmental impacts of everyday choices. It embodies the exploratory spirit of seeking out new ways to live sustainably, informed by the rich tapestry of insights offered by the authors and projects referenced.
