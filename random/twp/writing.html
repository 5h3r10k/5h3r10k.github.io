            <p>
                Embarking on the project of documenting and sharing my weekly trash collection was an endeavor born not just from curiosity but from a desire to engage deeply with the intricate tapestry of waste management, sustainability, and personal accountability. At its core, this journey was a quest to illuminate the shadows cast by the objects we discard, a process that Brian Thill describes as turning the "indifference engine" of litter into a subject of scrutiny and care <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Thill, 20)</a>. By adopting this lens, I sought not only to understand my own ecological footprint but also to initiate a dialogue with others on the pervasive issue of waste in our modern lives.

            <h2>Perspectives</h2>
            <p>
                The project, which began as a simple audit of my daily waste, evolved into a profound exploration of the ways in which our throwaway culture permeates our lifestyles. It was an attempt to confront the "revolution" that, as Muniz observes, "filled the world with objects that trivialized their own production and, consequently, their meaning" <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Muniz)</a>. This trivialization of objects, once essential and desired, morphs into indifference once their utility wanes. My aim was to challenge this indifference by highlighting the lifecycle of the items we consider disposable, thereby fostering a deeper connection with the material world around us.
                <br><br>
                In engaging with Newman's perspective that "Archaeology has sometimes been called 'the science of rubbish'" <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Newman)</a>, I sought to position my project not just as a personal journal or museum of discarded items but as a living archive that reflects both individual and collective memory, history, and culture. This approach allowed me to explore the intersection of waste and identity, examining how our trash can serve as a mirror to our societal values and individual choices.
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Themes</h2>
            <p>
                The transition towards sustainability was a key theme in my project, echoing the calls of Victor Vergara and Ramachandra Jammi for a shift from the linear economic model to a more sustainable approach like the circular economy <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(Vergara and Jammi)</a>. This paradigm shift was mirrored in my own journey as I moved from using disposable items to adopting reusable alternatives, such as transitioning from disposable MetroCards to a tap-to-pay system. This change, though seemingly minor, was a step towards minimizing my personal contribution to landfill waste and exemplifying the potential for individual actions to foster collective environmental change.
                <br><br>
                The project also drew inspiration from other online trash-related endeavors, notably the Clean Bin Project and Blog, which posits that "Living zero waste isn’t about deprivation; it’s about living with less and figuring out better solutions that just happen not to involve disposable packaging" <a href = "#refs" class="intext-link">(The Clean Bin Project and Blog)</a>. This ethos resonated deeply with my own experiences, reinforcing the idea that sustainability is not about sacrifice but about finding innovative and mindful ways to engage with the world.

            <h2>Outro</h2>
            <p>
                In documenting my journey, the project became more than just a personal audit; it evolved into a collective exploration of waste, identity, and sustainability. It straddled the line between an activist awareness-raising project and an art project, using the cataloging of daily waste as a medium to express a broader narrative on consumption, waste, and environmental responsibility. It was both exploratory and planned, a reflective practice that encouraged not just personal introspection but also communal dialogue.
                <br><br>
                As this project unfolded, it became clear that the act of documenting trash is not merely about the objects themselves but about challenging the norms of consumption and disposal that define our current epoch. It is an invitation to reconsider our roles not just as consumers but as stewards of our environment, to move beyond indifference and towards a more thoughtful and sustainable interaction with the world.
